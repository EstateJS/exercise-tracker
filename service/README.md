# Welcome to Estate!
This directory contains your Estate service source code.
You can add any kind of file here but only .js, .mjs, and .ts files may contain service source code.

If you haven't already, run this command to log in to your Estate account:
`$ estate login`

After making code changes run this command to update Estate as well as NPM project code gen:
`$ estate up`

When you're actively developing you can run this command instead which will run the background and run the up command as needed:
`$ estate dev`
