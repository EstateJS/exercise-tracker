# Welcome to Estate!
This directory contains your Estate backend service source code.
You can add any kind of file here but only .js, .mjs, and .ts files may contain service source code.

Login to Estate:
`$ estate login`

After making code changes, make them live with:
`$ cd service`
`$ estate deploy .`

Once your backend changes are deployed, generate code to connect to the latest version of your backend: 
`$ cd <npm project>`
`$ estate connect . exercise-tracker`
